          <p>NNF prepared the first set of recommendations on neonatal care in India in 1980. In 1982, a task force on Minimum Perinatal Care with participation of NNF and the government of India envisaged that 'level 1 care will be imparted through the trained TBAs and female health workers in the communityâ€™. In years that followed, several members of NNF experimented with community-based projects on newborn care; training of TBAs, health workers and nurses; small hospital newborn care models; utilization of workers of the Integrated Child Development services for newborn care; and simplifying the technology of newborn care to suit the low resource settings.

            In 1992 NNF recommended that Essential Newborn Care (ENC) got included as one of the components of child survival strategy (along with immunization, management of diarrhea and pneumonia and vitamin A prophylaxis ) for the first time. NNF assisted the government in developing the ENC package (consisting of neonatal resuscitation, prevention of hypothermia and infection, exclusive breastfeeding and referral of sick newborns).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            NNF was called upon to assist the government in operationalizing essential newborn care package in district, sub-district and first level referral units in the country. In 1994-95, NNF contributed to the development of Teaching Aids on Newborn Care .

            <br />
            By early nineties, NNF had succeeded in putting newborn health firmly on the national agenda through sustained advocacy and track record. Country wide Neonatal Resuscitation programme were launched by creating five regional hubs after TOT at Manipal Hospital during Annual Convention of NNF in 1989 , and gradually this got into pre-service education of UGs & Nursing graduates .
